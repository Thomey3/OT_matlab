    %DEVICE Class encapsulating a DAQmx device

    %NOTES
    %   At moment, it is not possible to delete Device objects.
    %   This is because of the peristent memory store containing the DeviceMap. 
    %   Without some reference counting scheme, there is no way to clear the handles stored by that Map anyway.
