function y = nansum(x,dim)
% FORMAT: Y = NANSUM(X,DIM)
% 
%    Sum of values ignoring NaNs
%
%    This function enhances the functionality of NANSUM as distributed in
%    the MATLAB Statistics Toolbox and is meant as a replacement (hence the
%    identical name).  
%
%    NANSUM(X,DIM) calculates the mean along any dimension of the N-D array
%    X ignoring NaNs.  If DIM is omitted NANSUM averages along the first
%    non-singleton dimension of X.
%
%    Similar replacements exist for NANMEAN, NANSTD, NANMEDIAN, NANMIN, and
%    NANMAX which are all part of the NaN-suite.
