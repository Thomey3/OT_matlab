function y = nanmean(x,dim)
% FORMAT: Y = NANMEAN(X,DIM)
% 
%    Average or mean value ignoring NaNs
%
%    This function enhances the functionality of NANMEAN as distributed in
%    the MATLAB Statistics Toolbox and is meant as a replacement (hence the
%    identical name).  
%
%    NANMEAN(X,DIM) calculates the mean along any dimension of the N-D
%    array X ignoring NaNs.  If DIM is omitted NANMEAN averages along the
%    first non-singleton dimension of X.
%
%    Similar replacements exist for NANSTD, NANMEDIAN, NANMIN, NANMAX, and
%    NANSUM which are all part of the NaN-suite.
