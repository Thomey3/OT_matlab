function generateAPIDocs(dir2Doc, shouldStripHref)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%GENERATEAPIDOCS Generates the API documentation for scanimage
% Performs a recursive search for .m files through all the directories starting from the
% current Matlab directory.  Uses the function saveHtmlDoc to produce HTML
% files for the .m files.  Function processDir starts from the current root
% directory and descends through the directory tree to make the cell array
% mFileList which contains all m file names and their locations.  This
% program requires jsoup.jar so that the function parserHtml will work.
% jsoup-1.11.3.jar is in a private folder that gets added more-or-less
% automatically to the java class path.  Hopefully, it doesn't conflict with
% anything.
% generateAPIDocs depends on scanimage\+scanimage\+util\+doc\DocGenExcludedDIRS.txt
% which contains the list of directories to exclude in the document
% generation process.
%
%
% You may need to change the following in order to get things to work:
%
% In dabs.ni.daqmx.private.DAQmxClass.m (line 1).  Change:
%
%       classdef DAQmxClass < most.APIWrapper & most.PDEPPropDynamic
%
% to
%
%       classdef DAQmxClass < handle
%
% run the documentation generator and then change things back.  The above
% solution provided a clue about the origin of the problem.  When the HTML
% documentation for AIChan.m is being produced, the handle to the
% instantiation of the class is lost.  The handle is lost because a which
% statement appears to alter the class and reset the handles.  It was noted
% that if the class was instantiated on the matlab command line before
% running generateAPIDocs.m then the error does not happen.  By
% instantiating the AIChan class at the beginning of this program in the
% base space, the error can also be prevented.
% Perhaps Mathworks will automagically do it for us one day.
